Under construction.

The goal of this program is to improve my python skills. Don't hesitate to make a suggestion to make it better (my skills and the program, of course).

First version

- The program only downloads the subtitles in english.

- The program returns a url where I suppose the subtitle is, but I have to deal with a event listener (click) in the browser so the subtitle can be download correctly. I haven't found the way to do it. Any sugestions?
